Once upon a time, there lived a boy named Banny Bevy. Banny appeared to live a
normal life in the city of Badison, Bisconsin. He owned a small restaurant 
Bian's Pizza, which sold wild flavors of pizza to Badison's intoxicated youth. 
But Banny had a secret: he was a magician. Since magic was illegal in Badison, 
Banny had to live a secret life. But all of that changed on March 13, 2020: 
Friday the 13th.
